# Regression test for fm-spawn.sh's shell-readiness gate (bin/fm-spawn.sh,
# spawn_wait_shell_ready and its two call sites).
#
# A pane's shell is not reading its pty the instant the pane exists. Anything
# typed before its line editor is up is swallowed - seen live on 2026-08-25
# spawning onto a project whose .envrc loads direnv plus devenv, where the
# echoed `treehouse get` sat above direnv's own loading line in the scrollback
# and never ran. Every spawn onto such a project failed. The pty echoes those
# swallowed keystrokes, so the pane's own text is not proof a command executed;
# only a side effect is.
#
# The fake backend here is a shell, not a stub: it models a pty line discipline
# with a swallow budget, discarding the first N submitted lines and EXECUTING
# every line after that. `treehouse get` therefore only moves the pane when it
# was actually delivered, and the agent only launches when its line was. Both
# spawn-time send stages are covered, because the pane's inner shell after
# `treehouse get` has its own startup and its own swallow window.
#
# The stub can also refuse a send outright, which is a DIFFERENT failure: a pane
# that cannot be reached at all is not a shell that is slow to start, and the
# spawn must attribute it that way instead of waiting out the whole readiness
# budget and then blaming shell-init latency.
#
# And a marker only proves anything while nothing else can write it. /tmp is
# world-writable and a task id is an ordinary slug, so the task temp root is a
# path another local account can pre-create: one case plants a root at a laxer
# mode and asserts the spawn keeps its marker in a private directory it created
# itself while leaving that root's mode alone, because a spawn that adjusted the
# mode of a path it did not create would follow a symlink raced into place; a
# second plants a root it cannot privately write and asserts a loud refusal
# rather than a marker that proves nothing. A third case pins the re-send
# cadence, which lands in the very scrollback an operator reads when a spawn is
# slow.
